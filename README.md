# Space Dim project
Studies about n-dimensional things and their representations

### Spaces and Objects
SpacesObj is a set of files that help to handle the mappings and the objects in the various dimensions.
The "objects" (DimObject) are sets of points treated as graphs in some dimension.

### Space and Objects For SFML
Inside the folder SpacesObj, there is another folder called SpacesObjForSFML, which contains some implementations used to help the graphical representation in some cases. The SFML API is used here.
