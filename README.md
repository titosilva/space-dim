# Space Dim project
Welcome to Space Dim project! This project just intends to make a generalization for some functions and structures for n-dimensional things and, obviously, to have some fun :laughing:
In the wiki you can find out some explanation(or at least a try :disappointed::sweat_smile:) about how the things work. 

Hope you enjoy! :alien:
